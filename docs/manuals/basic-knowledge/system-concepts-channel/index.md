# Channel Concepts

## Basic Concepts
In an IoT system, terminal devices, data acquisition gateways, and cloud platforms need to communicate through various methods for data collection, remote control, and device status monitoring. To standardize device onboarding and data management, the platform draws on proven experience in Industrial IoT (IIoT) and power automation (SCADA) and introduces concepts such as **Channel, Channel Point, Protocol, Four Remote types (Telemetry/Signal/Control/Adjustment), and Mapping**.
These concepts form the core logic for communication between devices and the cloud, and are key to understanding device onboarding, point configuration, data formats, and gateway behavior.
