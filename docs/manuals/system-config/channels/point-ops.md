3. Click **Submit Publish** to submit the bulk publish.
4. Click **Cancel Publish** to cancel.
5. On success, the values change.

## Batch Edit Points

2. During editing, you can filter by status (only within the current point-type table):

- **modified**: Filters points that were actually modified. Modified rows are shown in blue, and modified data is highlighted in blue.

- **added**: Filters points added via the add operation. Added rows and data are shown in green.

  ![23](/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/23.png)

- **deleted**: Filters points deleted via the delete operation. Deleted rows and data are shown in red.

  ![24](/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/24.png)

- **invalid**: Filters points with issues after add/modify. Problematic rows show orange markers with a dark red background.

  ![25](/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/25.png)
  Point configuration rules:
- `point_id`: Positive integer (required, unique)
- `signal_name`: String, no spaces allowed (required)
- `scale`: Numeric (required)
- `offset`: Numeric (required)
- `unit`: String (optional)
- `reverse`: true/false (required)

> **Note: Point edits follow batch-edit principles. Make all changes locally first, then click Submit only after all changes are complete and error-free. The same applies to later mapping edits.**

### Import Points from a File

![26](/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/26.png)

1. Click **Import**, choose a **.csv** file to import. File requirements differ by point type:

* telemetry/adjustment

  - Required headers **(must include the following; extra headers are ignored)**:

    `point_id,signal_name,scale,offset,unit,reverse`

  - Field descriptions: follow the point configuration rules.

  - Format screenshot:

    <img src="/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/27.png" alt="27" style="zoom: 33%;" />

* signal/control

  * Required headers (must include the following; extra headers are ignored):

    `point_id,point_name,reverse`

  * Field descriptions: follow the point configuration rules.

  * Format screenshot:
  
    <img src="/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/27(1).png" alt="27(1)" style="zoom: 33%;" />

>**Note:**
>
>- **All imported records are rendered as "added" (green highlight). Even with validation errors, records are imported but marked as "invalid" so you can fix them in the UI.**
>- **Each import overwrites the current point information.**

### Add Points

![28](/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/28.png)

1. Click the **Add** icon button to create an editable row at the top of the current point-type table.
2. Fill in the row according to the configuration rules.
3. Click the **checkmark** icon to confirm the local add.
4. Click the **X** icon to cancel the local add.
5. After confirmation, the new row appears as shown and can be filtered by **added**.

> **Note: Each tab allows only one pending add at a time. A new add row appears only after the previous add is confirmed or canceled. If a pending add row exists, clicking Add again will not create another row.**

### Delete Points

![29](/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/29.png)

1. Click the **delete** icon for the target row to delete it locally.
2. Deleted rows appear as shown and can be filtered by **deleted**.
3. Click the restore icon to undo the local delete.

### Modify Points

![30](/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/30.png)

4. Click the **confirm** icon to save the local modification.
5. Click the **cancel** icon to cancel the modification.
6. Modified rows appear as shown, with changed data marked in blue and filterable by **modified**.

### Submit All Changes

![31](/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/31.png)

2. Click **Submit** to submit the batch changes.
3. Click **Cancel Edit** to exit edit mode and restore the original point data.

## Export Point CSV Files

![32](/images/Setting/Configuration/channel/32.png).png)

Click **Export** to export the table data under the current tab as **.csv**. The filename format is: **channel name + tab name (telemetry/signal/control/adjustment) + current timestamp**.
