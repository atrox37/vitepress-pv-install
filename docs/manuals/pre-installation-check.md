# Pre-installation Inspection and Testing

1. **Component Inspection**

   - Full inspection of samples, batch sampling of 5% per batch.

   - Check whether all components and standard parts in the list are complete, missing, or damaged.

   - Check whether key components (such as bearings, rollers, rails) have rust, deformation, or wear.

   - Measure key dimensions (such as shaft diameter, hole diameter, installation hole size, etc.) to ensure they meet drawing requirements.

   - Check whether fit tolerances (such as interference fit, transition fit, clearance fit) are appropriate.


2. **Main Tool Inspection and Verification**

   - Before installation, check whether all tools are complete and usable, and check whether electric tools have safety hazards.

   - Whether electric tools such as torque wrenches, electric wrenches, and laser alignment instruments are calibrated and usable.

   - Whether lifting equipment such as forklifts and slings meet load requirements and have no safety hazards.
