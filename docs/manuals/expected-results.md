# Expected Installation Results and Effects

* **Structural Integrity**

  - All components are correctly assembled without omissions or misassembly.

  - Connecting parts (bolts, pins) are securely connected and meet strength requirements.


* **Operating Stability**

  - The photovoltaic bracket structure operates smoothly without obvious vibration or abnormal noise.

  - Transmission components (rollers, bearings, node connectors) fit well without jamming or slipping.


* **Functional Realization**
  - The photovoltaic bracket structure can complete all movements and functions designed (such as folding angle, translation, etc.).


* **Service Life**

  - After installation, wear at connection points is normal without early failure risks (such as bearing end cap falling off and poor lubrication).

  - Avoid structural wear caused by installation stress, misalignment, and other issues that affect service life.
