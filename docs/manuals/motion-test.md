# Motion Test

Requirements:

- Operational flexibility: During manual testing, folding and unfolding actions should be flexible and smooth, without looseness or excessive tightness.
- Operating condition: During the entire sliding process, there should be no jamming sensation or any abnormal noise (such as friction sounds, impact sounds).
- Folding positioning accuracy: In the fully folded state, the edges of all components should be aligned without obvious misalignment or uneven gaps.
- Smoothness of unfolding process: The entire process from startup to full unfolding should be smooth and continuous without hesitation.
