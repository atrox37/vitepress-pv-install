# Product

## Definition 

A product is a standardized model for a device/system type in the platform, used to abstract the capabilities and data interfaces that this type should have in EMS. A product does not represent a specific on-site device, but rather the common structure and standard interface of the same device type. It defines what the device looks like in the platform and what capabilities it has:

- What points it includes (property points, measurement points, action points)
- What each point represents (e.g., SOC, power, alarms, start/stop, power setpoints, etc.)
A product is not a specific on-site device, but a "generic definition for similar devices."
The platform provides the following products:
- **battery_cell** (cell)
  - Definition: The smallest electrochemical unit of a battery system.
  - Role: Provides the most basic voltage/temperature data, the foundation for BMS monitoring and safety evaluation.
  ---
- **battery_module** (battery module)
  - Definition: A structural and electrical unit composed of multiple cells.
  - Role: Aggregates cell-level data, commonly used for module voltage, temperature distribution, balancing/protection management and display.
  ---
- **battery_cluster** (battery cluster/battery bank)
  - Definition: A higher-level aggregation composed of multiple battery modules (often corresponding to the scope of one cluster BMS).
  - Role: Provides cluster-level SOC/SOH, voltage/current, alarms, enabling EMS strategy and safety coordination.
  ---
- **battery_stack** (battery stack/string)
  - Definition: A system-level series/parallel unit composed of multiple battery clusters (often one battery stack in engineering practice).
  - Role: Provides system-level DC key metrics (total voltage/total current/total power) and stack-level alarms for coordination with PCS/DC conversion.
  ---
- **battery_pack** (battery pack/battery system pack)
  - Definition: A more asset/system-oriented abstraction for the battery side in EMS (often used to summarize the overall capability of a BESS battery system).
  - Role: Used for capacity, ratings, runtime statistics, alarm aggregation, reporting, and asset management; often serves as the top-level battery object for BESS.
  ---
- **dc_dc_converter** (DC/DC converter)
  - Definition: DC-to-DC power conversion equipment (boost/buck/isolation, etc.).
  - Role: Matches different DC bus voltage levels and supports energy regulation and protection coordination; commonly used in battery-side/DC bus power control loops.
  ---
- **pcs** (power conversion system)
  - Definition: Core power conversion equipment in energy storage systems (DC-AC).
  - Role: Executes charge/discharge power control, grid-connected/off-grid operation, reactive support, and power quality control; key target for EMS strategies and execution.
  ---
- **diesel_generator** (diesel generator)
  - Definition: Controllable backup/emergency/peak-shaving power source.
  - Role: Provides stable power in off-grid or weak-grid scenarios; supports start/stop control, power regulation, operating status, and fault monitoring.
  ---
- **motor** (motor)
  - Definition: Motor-type load/device (as a drive device or key process device abstraction).
  - Role: Used to monitor operating status, power/current, etc.; some scenarios support start/stop or speed control (depending on site control and points).
  ---
- **load** (load)
  - Definition: Aggregated load or controllable load object on the consumption side (e.g., campus load, building load, production line load).
  - Role: Core input for EMS load forecasting, energy balance, peak shaving, and demand response; supports strategy linkage when extended as controllable load.
  ---
- **pv_string** (PV string)
  - Definition: A generation unit formed by series-connected modules.
  - Role: String-level voltage/current/power monitoring, helpful for locating shading, mismatch, and degradation issues (depending on access capability).
  ---
- **pv_optimizer** (optimizer)
  - Definition: Module/string-level power optimization and monitoring device.
  - Role: Improves generation efficiency and supports finer-grained monitoring and fault localization; typically associated with string/module data.
  ---
- **pv_combiner** (combiner box)
  - Definition: Device that combines multiple strings in parallel to a DC bus.
  - Role: Aggregates string circuits and provides branch current/switch/surge protection monitoring; key node between strings and inverters.
  ---
- **pv_inverter** (PV inverter)
  - Definition: Device that converts PV DC power to AC for grid connection/supply.
  - Role: Output power control, grid operation management, reactive/power-quality support, and status/alarm monitoring; main controlled/monitored object on the PV side in EMS.
  ---
- **gateway** (gateway)
  - Definition: Acquisition and protocol conversion node connecting site devices to the cloud/platform.
  - Role: Hosts channels and protocols, performs data acquisition upload and command delivery; responsible for point mapping, caching, edge computing/forwarding (depending on implementation).
  ---
- **station** (site/station)
  - Definition: Top-level organizational object for a microgrid/site (one project or one station).
  - Role: Hosts the site device tree, topology, and aggregate metrics (site power/energy/alarms), and serves as the unified entry for permissions, reporting, dispatch strategies, and O&M.

## Role

- Unify point collections and semantics for the same device type (standardization)
- Support bulk instantiation (multiple device instances for one product)
- Facilitate system integration, operations, and configuration reuse
