# Structural Stability Check

Key points to check:

- Check whether all bolts are tightened, based on (whether lines are drawn after bolt tightening).
- Whether the rail connection parts are smooth (use a level to detect).
- Whether the folding hinge rotation direction is correct (check the shaft rod hinge installation direction).
