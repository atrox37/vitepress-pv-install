# Purpose and Importance of Installation Manual

The installation manual is not only a technical document but also a critical reference for ensuring the assembly quality, safety, and reliability of photovoltaic brackets. Proper use of the installation manual can reduce error rates, save time, and is an indispensable part of the photovoltaic bracket assembly process.

- Guide installation process: Clarify installation steps, sequence, and methods to avoid operational errors.
- Ensure installation accuracy: Ensure that the dimensions, positions, and fits of the bracket structure meet design requirements.
- Improve safety: Prevent equipment damage or personnel injury caused by installation errors.
- Standardize operations: Unified installation according to specifications can effectively prevent differences caused by human factors.
- Avoid installation errors: Incorrect installation may lead to structural failure or functional failure.
- Improve installation efficiency: Clear installation instructions can reduce debugging time, avoid rework due to errors, and improve installation efficiency.
- Ensure bracket reliability: Correct installation directly affects the operating stability, vibration, noise, and other key performance indicators of the bracket.
- Reduce maintenance costs: Standardized installation can reduce subsequent maintenance frequency and extend service life.
