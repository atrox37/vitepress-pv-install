# Rule Chain

## Definition

A rule flow is the visual execution flow inside a rule. It uses "nodes + links" to describe the full execution path of a rule from start to finish. It breaks a rule into steps (such as start, condition, action, end) and uses branching to express different paths under different conditions.
## Role

- Clearly express complex logic: Present multi-condition, multi-branch, multi-action strategies as flowcharts, reducing understanding and configuration costs.
- Traceable and diagnosable: During runtime, the actual execution path and key node data can be located to quickly identify why a decision was made.
- Easy to maintain and iterate: Quickly adjust steps and branches with a graphical structure, with versioning and import/export reuse.
