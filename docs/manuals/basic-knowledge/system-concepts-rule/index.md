# Rule Concepts

## Basic Concepts
In EMS systems, devices such as batteries, PCS, PV, and diesel generators must cooperate under constantly changing operating conditions. The system must make judgments based on real-time measurements and promptly issue control commands or adjust operating parameters (such as power setpoints, start/stop, mode switching) to achieve safe, stable, and economical operation. To standardize strategy configuration and visual management, the platform introduces concepts such as **Rule** and **Rule Flow**.
