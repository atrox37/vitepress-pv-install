# Channel Points

## Definition

A channel point is a real data point of a device under a specific protocol (actual register address or signal address). A point is the smallest unit for data acquisition and command delivery.
For example, in Modbus:

- Voltage may be at address 40001
- Current may be at address 40002
- Device start/stop may be at 00001 (coil)
  These registers or flags are channel points.

## Point Classification
The platform classifies points according to the "four remote" standard in industrial automation:

| Type | Name       | Description                                   |
| ---- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Telemetry | Telemetry  | Continuous/analog values (e.g., temperature, voltage) |
| Signal | Signal     | Discrete/switch values (e.g., on/off, alarm)  |
| Control | Control    | Control commands issued by the platform (e.g., start/stop) |
| Adjustment | Adjustment | Parameter setpoints issued by the platform (e.g., frequency or voltage setpoint) |

The point type determines whether it is read-only (Telemetry/Signal) or write-type (Control/Adjustment).

>Note: For `di_do` channels, point types are only Signal and Control because the values are only 0 and 1.

## Field Description

Each channel point typically includes:

- `point_id`: Unique point ID (positive integer).
- `signal_name`: Business signal name.
- `value`: Current value of the point.
- `scale/offset`: Scaling and offset for converting raw values to business values.
- `unit`: Unit of the point.
- `reverse`: Whether the value should be inverted (commonly for switch points).

> **Note: For Signal and Control points, the `scale`, `offset`, and `unit` fields are not required.**
