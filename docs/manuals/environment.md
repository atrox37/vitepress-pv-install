# Ensure Suitable Installation Environment

1. Site Environment

   Ensure that the factory installation site size meets the total installation area requirements, there are no safety hazards around the installation site, and the installation site will not affect other emergency uses in the short term to avoid disassembly and rework. Dust, oil, metal chips, and other contaminants should be prevented from entering key components (such as bearings and rails).

2. Basic Protective Equipment

   Protective items must be worn (safety shoes, protective gloves, safety helmets, etc.).
