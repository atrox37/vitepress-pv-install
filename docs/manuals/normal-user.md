# Regular User Manual

## Platform Introduction

![index](/images/common/index.png)
 **Monarch Edge** is a comprehensive monitoring and analytics platform for edge energy sites, designed to provide users with a clear, unified, and visual view of site operations. The platform covers key business scenarios such as generation, energy storage, energy usage, and alarms. With standardized interfaces and consistent interactions, it helps users quickly understand device status, operational trends, and abnormal conditions, improving daily O&M efficiency and management quality.
  The platform's main capabilities include:

- **Site overview**: Centralized display of energy summary, energy flow, power/energy trends, and site/device highlights to quickly assess operational health.
- **Device monitoring**: Overview and value-monitoring pages by device type (PV, storage, meters, diesel generators, etc.), supporting real-time data and status viewing.
- **Alarm management**: Separate current and historical alarms with query, filter, and export for troubleshooting and traceability.
- **Operation statistics**: Statistical overview, curve analysis, and run/operation logs to support data review and trend analysis.
- **Unified experience**: Consistent interactions such as table filters, pagination, and update-time hints to reduce learning cost.
**This manual is intended for regular users.**

## General UI Structure and Function Description

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

1. The page has no data and device Update Time does not change
Please check in order:
1. Refresh the page (F5)
2. Switch to another menu and switch back
3. Check whether the top bar can jump to the alarm page (verifies base routing)
4. Ask the administrator to check:
  - Whether the backend service is normal
  - Whether the WebSocket push source is normal
  - Whether devices/channels are online
It is recommended to provide the administrator with:
- The page where the issue occurs (e.g., Devices > PV > Value Monitoring)
- The time the issue occurred
- Whether all devices have no data or only a specific type has no data
2. After logging in, you are redirected back to the login page
Possible causes:
- Account expired or password incorrect
- Token refresh failed
Suggestions:
- Log in again
- If it still fails, contact the administrator to reset the account
