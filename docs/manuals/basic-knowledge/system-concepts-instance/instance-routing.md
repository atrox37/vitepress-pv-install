# Instance Point Routing

## Definition

Instance point mapping binds platform "instance points" to on-site "channel points/addresses." It answers the following key questions for each instance point:
**Which channel and point on-site does it map to? Which of the four remote types does it belong to?**

* For **measurement** points, the channel point type can only be **Telemetry** or **Signal**.
* For **action** points, the channel point type can only be **Control** or **Adjustment**.
* **property** points are intrinsic attributes and have no routing info.

## Field Description

* `point_id`: ID of the instance point.
* `name`: Name of the point.
* `channel_id`: ID of the channel used by the route.
* `channel_type`: Four-remote type of the channel point.
* `channel_point_id`: Channel point ID used by the route.

## Role

- Data uplink (acquisition): Channel data is routed to the corresponding measurement points.
- Command downlink (control): Values written to action points are routed to the corresponding channel points and sent to devices.
- Decouple business and protocol: Business logic focuses on point semantics; communication focuses on addresses; mapping connects them to allow protocol/gateway/point-table changes.
