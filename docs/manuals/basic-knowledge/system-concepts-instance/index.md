# Device Instance Concepts

## Basic Concepts
In microgrid EMS, to standardize device onboarding and point management, the platform introduces the basic concepts of products, instances, instance points, and instance routing (mapping): a product defines the standard capabilities and point model for a device type; an instance is a specific on-site device object for a product; instance points represent the device's configuration and runtime data and are classified as **property / measurement / action** by use; instance mapping (routing) binds instance points to on-site channel points (and to T/S/C/A types) to ensure accurate data reporting and control/adjustment issuance.
