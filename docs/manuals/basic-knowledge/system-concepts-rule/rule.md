# Rule

## Definition
A rule is the basic unit used in EMS to express an "operating strategy." It describes the control logic the system should take under specific conditions. It takes real-time data (measurements/status/computed results) as inputs, determines the current scenario through conditions, and outputs corresponding control actions or parameter adjustments.
## Role

- Strategy solidification and automated execution: Configure human experience/dispatch strategies into logic that the system can execute automatically for unattended operation.
- Operational objectives: Automatically choose appropriate control measures under different conditions to meet safety, stability, economy, and efficiency goals.
- Unified management and reuse: Rules can be centrally managed (enable/disable, priority, etc.) and reused across different sites or projects.
